## The Inspiration

- Recently, I have found myself to be  
  describe purpose (niche apps are becoming more popular as people crave community over mutual interests, such as Beli, Strava, GoodReads)
- explain what the "competitor" apps lack (dice, gigit, concert archives)

## The App

- features/core functionality
- include screenshots and maybe gif
- target audience

## Plans for future work

- Fetch event data from [EDM train](https://edmtrain.com) to display raves/festivals that aren't shown in Ticketmaster
- Add filters/sorting to list of marked concerts, profile feed, and search results
- On any given event, display text stating how many friends saved/attended it and upon clicking this text, show popup modal listing those friends
- Handle notifications and comments
- Implement autocomplete search bar for searching events
- When marking an event as attended, enable users to upload photos/videos of their experience at the event
